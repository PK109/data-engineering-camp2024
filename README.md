# Data Engineering Course Highlights üöÄ

Welcome to my DE repository! This space showcases the key skills and concepts I learned during an intensive **Data Engineering ZoomCamp** course provided by _DataTalks.Club_. Below are the main areas of expertise I gained through hands-on practice with these technologies.

## üîë Key Skills & Concepts

### 1. **Containerization and Infrastructure as Code**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Proficient in containerizing applications and setting up multi-container environments.
- **PostgreSQL with Docker**: Managed local databases using Docker.
- **Terraform**: Automated cloud infrastructure provisioning on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

### 2. **Workflow Orchestration**
- **Introduction to Orchestration**: Learned the principles of orchestrating data workflows for efficient pipeline management.
- **Mage.ai**: Gained hands-on experience using **Mage** to build and automate ETL pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Developed ETL pipelines to move data between systems like **Postgres**, **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, and **BigQuery**.

### 3. **Data Warehousing**
- **BigQuery**: Designed and optimized data warehouses using **Google BigQuery**.
- **Partitioning & Clustering**: Implemented best practices for efficient querying and data storage.
- **BigQuery ML**: Applied machine learning models within BigQuery for data-driven insights.

### 4. **Analytics Engineering**
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**: Built and maintained transformation models for **BigQuery** and **Postgres** using dbt.
- **Data Visualization**: Created dashboards and reports using **Google Data Studio** and **Metabase** to communicate insights.

### 5. **Batch Processing**
- **Apache Spark**: Processed large datasets using **Spark DataFrames** and **Spark SQL** for batch data processing.
- **Spark UI**: Using Web UI to monitor job execution and general state of Spark Master and Workers. 

### 6. **Streaming Data**
- **Apache Kafka**: Implemented real-time data pipelines using **Kafka**, ensuring efficient data ingestion and processing.

## üìù Course Summary
This course provided me with hands-on experience in cloud-based data engineering solutions, covering containerization, workflow orchestration, data transformation, and more.
